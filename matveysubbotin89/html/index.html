			<ul>
				<li>How is he calculate number of banknotes according to your request?</li>
				<li>What will he do when one of banknotes basket is empty?</li>
				<li>What is happens when you type number, which is higher as available?</li>

		</div>
		<div id="Input">
			<h2><u> Input data </u></h2>
			<p> How many money user needs. This information are transferring to program as input data.<br>User should type number in field. The number must be integer and uses available nominals banknotes as dividers. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="Output">
			<h2><u>Output data </u></h2>
			<p id= "p1"> Program will return dictionary, dictionary includes every nominals of banknotes as key and number of banknotes as value of this key.<br>The result will have been showed like this <code>{5: 1, 10: 6, 20: 10, 50: 10, 100: 1, 200: 0, 500: 1, 1000: 1}</code>. It does mean user entered nuber 2365.<br>If you summ all banknotes (key*value), the result will eqvel to input number.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="Feature">
			<h2><u> Feature of the program </u></h2>
